I rise in firm support of the motion: There needs to be strict laws to regulate Large Language Models. This is not a matter of stifling innovation, but a critical imperative for public safety, democratic integrity, and ethical accountability in the face of a technology whose power and potential for harm are unprecedented.

First, consider the profound risks of unregulated LLMs. Without strict legal guardrails, these models can and will be used to generate hyper-realistic disinformation at an industrial scale, eroding trust in media, destabilizing elections, and undermining social cohesion. They can create malicious code, facilitate sophisticated phishing attacks, and automate fraud, posing a direct threat to national cybersecurity. Furthermore, their capacity to perpetuate and amplify societal biases—in hiring, lending, and law enforcement—can codify discrimination into our most critical systems, causing real-world harm to marginalized communities. Self-regulation by developers is demonstrably insufficient; commercial incentives to release ever-more-powerful models will consistently outpace voluntary ethical commitments.

Second, the existential nature of the technology demands a proactive legal framework. LLMs are not mere tools; they are foundational technologies that will reshape economies, labor markets, and the very fabric of human communication. We are at a constitutional moment, akin to the early days of the internet or biotechnology. Waiting for catastrophic misuse to occur before acting is a reckless abdication of governance. Strict laws are necessary to establish clear liability for harms, mandate transparency in training data and model capabilities, enforce rigorous pre-deployment safety testing, and create auditable standards for fairness and accuracy. This legal certainty is also good for responsible industry, creating a level playing field and preventing a "race to the bottom" on safety.

Finally, this is about democratic sovereignty and human agency. The development of artificial general intelligence, of which advanced LLMs are a significant step, is arguably the most important event in human history. To leave its trajectory solely in the hands of a few unaccountable corporate entities is an unacceptable surrender of our collective future. Strict regulation, developed through democratic processes, ensures that this transformative technology serves the public interest—promoting human flourishing, protecting fundamental rights, and aligning progress with our shared values. The alternative is a Wild West where power is concentrated, harms are externalized, and society plays catch-up with a force it does not control.

Therefore, the conclusion is inescapable. The immense potential of LLMs is matched only by their profound risks. To harness the benefits while mitigating the dangers, we must enact strict, sensible, and enforceable laws. It is the only responsible path forward. I urge the house to support the motion.
