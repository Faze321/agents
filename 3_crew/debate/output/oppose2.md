I rise in firm opposition to the motion. While the concerns raised are understandable, the call for strict laws to regulate Large Language Models is a premature and counterproductive overreaction that will stifle innovation, entrench monopolies, and create a false sense of security while failing to address the core challenges.

First, the argument for strict laws is predicated on a speculative fear of catastrophic harm, not on evidence of systemic failure. Proponents paint a picture of an unregulated "Wild West," but this ignores the robust existing legal frameworks that already govern the outputs and applications of LLMs. Laws against fraud, defamation, discrimination, intellectual property theft, and cybercrime are not rendered obsolete by AI. If an LLM generates malicious code used in an attack, existing criminal statutes apply. If it produces discriminatory hiring recommendations, anti-discrimination laws are triggered. The problem is not an absence of law but the need for effective enforcement of current laws in a new context. Creating a dense, novel regulatory regime for the *technology itself*, rather than its misuse, risks creating redundant, conflicting rules that burden developers while doing little to stop bad actors who already operate outside the law.

Second, strict, prescriptive regulation at this nascent stage will cement the advantage of a few large tech incumbents and crush open-source innovation and academic research. The compliance costs of navigating a complex new legal landscape—with mandates for exhaustive audits, transparency reports, and pre-deployment government approvals—are trivial for billion-dollar corporations but prohibitive for startups, independent researchers, and public institutions. This will create an impenetrable moat around the technology, ensuring its development is controlled by the very "few unaccountable corporate entities" the motion decries. We will get a heavily regulated, homogenized AI ecosystem from a handful of providers, rather than a vibrant, competitive, and diverse field where safety and capability are advanced through open scrutiny and rapid iteration. The "race to the bottom" the motion fears will be replaced by a "crawl to the mediocre," where innovation is sacrificed for compliance.

Finally, the motion fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the technology. LLMs are not static products like pharmaceuticals or aircraft; they are dynamic, general-purpose tools that evolve at a blistering pace. Any strict law enacted today will be obsolete by the time it passes through legislative committees. Legislators cannot hope to technically outpace developers. Attempting to do so will either freeze development at today's level or, more likely, drive cutting-edge research into jurisdictions with laxer rules, creating the very regulatory arbitrage and global instability we wish to avoid. A more prudent approach is agile governance: fostering industry standards, investing in bias-mitigation research, promoting algorithmic auditing as a profession, and strengthening international cooperation on norms. This allows for adaptive, risk-based oversight that evolves with the technology, rather than a rigid legal straitjacket that breaks at the first sign of progress.

Therefore, the conclusion is clear. The path to safe and beneficial AI is not through preemptive, strict regulation that smothers innovation in its cradle. It is through the vigilant application of existing laws to harmful outcomes, the promotion of open and competitive development to avoid concentration of power, and the cultivation of flexible, expertise-driven governance that can keep pace with change. We must guide this technology, not chain it. I urge the house to reject this well-intentioned but ultimately dangerous motion.
